 * The mainClasses package holds some of the most significant classes for running the GUI.
 * 
 * Main.java loads the Game Player as an application.
 * GuiManager.java serves as an overarching controller for all of the GUI items.
 * GuiElement is an interface that requires all classes that implement it to provide a Node and to initialize their sizes based on a container size.
 * 		This interface is useful for making sure that all GUI Items are implemented properly and consistently.
