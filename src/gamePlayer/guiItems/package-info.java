 * 
 * The guiItems package has all of the different items that make up the individual GUI modules.
 * Each item implements the GuiItem interface for organizational purposes.
 * 
 * These items define their size based on the size of the container that holds them, 
 * 		which allows the items to be mixed and matched among containers without much modification.
 * 
 * Adding a new item requires writing an XML file within properties.guiItems, and writing a listener interface for it.
